  Hello! Welcome to my <i>(Con, 24/X/NYC)</i> website. This site was built to consolidate much
  of my life on and offline, including relevant work samples, text, images, and
  so on. If you are seeking text-image services, please refer to the 
  left side of the page, or click <a href="mailto:connormhinson@gmail.com">here</a> 
  to contact me via email. If you would like to read my blog, please 
  explore the images on the right. This site is best viewed on a desktop 
  computer, but I am working on making it cute for mobile.

<h5>
  A breif about me
</h5>
<p>  
  I graduated university with a BA in <a href="http://www.design.ucla.edu/">Design | Media Arts</a>.
  In my free time I enjoy online research, going on walks through Prospect Park, 
  dancing late into the night, sharing music, coming up with new ways to say things,
  posting, reading, programming. Here's what I'm enjoying at the moment:
</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Book:</strong>Ubik by Philip K Dick</li> 
  <li><strong>Mix:</strong><a href="https://www.bus-editions.com/bus058/bus058.mp3">bus058</a></li> 
  <li><strong>Vim</strong></li> 
  <li>My<strong>iPod</strong></li> 
</ul>
<p>
  nervous.works is dedicated to the research of text-image.
