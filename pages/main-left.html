<strong>Welcome:</strong>
<p>
  Hello! Welcome to my <i>(Con, 25/F/NYC)</i> website. This site was built to consolidate much
  of my life on and offline, including relevant work samples, text, images, and
  so on. This site is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and minimal Javascript for decoupling navigation
  from page refreshing. The left and right sides of this site can be navigated independently, and the  
  arrows at the bottom will return you to their respective home pages. 
  If you are seeking text-image services, please email me at connormhinson@gmail.com. 
  This site is best viewed on a desktop computer, but I am working on making it cute for mobile.

  I graduated university with a BA in <a href="http://www.design.ucla.edu/" target="_blank">Design | Media Arts</a>.
  In my free time I enjoy online research, going on walks through Prospect Park, 
  dancing late into the night, sharing music, coming up with new ways to say things,
  posting, reading, cooking.
