  1. _____ is online

  I started writing this post some months ago, when I first began seriously
  teaching myself Javascript. Learning more about the architecture of the internet,
  it's tangled substrate of protocols and servers and submarine comms cables,
  forced me to consider more carefully the ways in which I interface with 
  these technologies. There's too much of everything, obviously. It's too late
  to opt out. Submit to the impossibly smooth-fast, or be left behind.
