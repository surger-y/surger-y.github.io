              and organizing my digital life because it’s comforting to me, and
              right now I’m unemployed, or I guess under-emplyed tehcnically but
              that’s splitting hairs. This is a process I undergo sparatically,
              maybe once per year, and I have yet to standardize my method. This
              year I’ve set the goal of complete simplification of my digital
              life, and this post is an attempt at standardization, to create a
              precise and repeatable protocol for simplifying ones digital life.
              I will not define what constitutes ones digital life, nor am I
              meaning to draw such a distinct boundary line between ones digital
              life, and ones life in the real world, ones corporeal life or
              something. What I’m seeking is total organizational bliss, to live
              blissfully. Before we get to the protocol, I’d like to ennumerate
              some commandments or guiding principles for my process, which you
              can imagine as “I will” statements or maybe something more
              God-fearing like “I pray”:
