        And in this instant-now I see white statues scattered in the perspective of
        faraway distances far off—farther and farther in the desert where I get lost
        with empty gaze, I myself a statue to be seen from afar, I who am always
        getting lost. I am savoring whatever exists. Hushed, aerial, inside my great
        dream. Since I understand nothing—I therefore adhere to the faltering
        mobile reality. I reach the real through the dream. I invent you, reality. And
        hear you like remote bells deafly drowned in the water pealing palpitating.
        Am I in the core of death? And is that why I am alive? The feeling core.
        And this it exhilarates me. I am alive. Like a wound, flower in the flesh, the
        path of sorrowful blood is opened within me. With the direct and for that
        very reason innocent eroticism of the Indians of the Holy Pool. I, exposed
        to the storms, I, open inscription on the back of a stone, within the large
        chronological spaces handed down by the man of prehistory. The hot wind
        of great millenary expanses blows and singes my surface.
        Today I used red ochre, yellow ochre, black, and a little white. I sense that I
        am near springs, pools and waterfalls, all with abundant and fresh waters
        for my thirst. And I, a savage at last and at last free of the dry days of today:
        I trot forward and backward without frontiers. I carry out sun rituals on the
        slopes of high mountains. But I am also taboo for myself, untouchable
        because forbidden. Am I the hero that carries with him the burning torch
        forever in a race?
        Ah Force of whatever Exists, help me, Thou whom they call the God. Why
        does the horrible-terrible call me? that I in my horror want? because my
        demon is murderous and fears no punishment: but the crime is more
        important than the punishment. I enliven all of me in my happy instinct for
        destruction.
        Try to understand what I am painting and what I am writing now. I’ll
        explain: in painting as in writing I try to see strictly in the moment in which
        I see—and not to see through the memory of having seen in a past instant.
        The instant is this one. The instant is of an imminence that takes my breath
        away. The instant is in itself imminent. At the same time that I live it, I
        burst into its passage into another instant.
