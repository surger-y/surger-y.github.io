                If I make the lashes dark And the eyes more bright And the lips
                more scarlet, Or ask if all be right From mirror after mirror,
                No vanity’s displayed: I’m looking for the face I had Before the
                world was made. What if I look upon a man As though on my
                beloved, And my blood be cold the while And my heart unmoved?
                Why should he think me cruel Or that he is betrayed? I’d have
                him love the thing that was Before the world was made.

                fr. 14 None Such as Him <em>He looks to memory.</em> None such:
                amid the butting bulls none such on the death flanks of Hermos.
                None. Those elders who saw him saw the source points. It stung
                God. They say his spinal cord ran straight out of the sun.
